# Holistic Wellness Coaching Platform

## Challenge

Resonance Wellness Institute wanted to scale their one-on-one coaching practice into a digital platform while maintaining the personal, transformative experience their clients valued. They needed a system that could handle personalized wellness plans, track emotional and physical progress, and facilitate coach-client relationships at scale without losing the human touch.

**Key Challenges:**

- Scale from 50 to 500+ clients without losing personalization
- Track both emotional and physical wellness metrics
- Integrate diverse practices (somatic, meditation, nutrition)
- Maintain high touch points between coaches and clients
- Provide meaningful progress insights and adaptive recommendations

## Solution

We designed and developed a holistic wellness platform featuring personalized dashboards, progress tracking, secure video conferencing, and AI-assisted wellness recommendations. The platform integrates emotional check-ins, somatic exercise libraries, meditation guides, and nutrition planning.

### Platform Features

**For Clients:**

- Daily emotional check-ins and mood tracking
- Guided somatic exercise library with video

**For Coaches:**

- Real-time client progress monitoring
- Session notes and treatment plans
- Analytics and outcome tracking
- Automated administrative tasks
- Resource library management

### Technologies & Architecture

We implemented a modular coaching framework that allows coaches to customize programs while maintaining best-practice structure. The platform uses React and Next.js for the frontend, Node.js and GraphQL for the backend, WebRTC for video sessions, and TensorFlow for AI-powered wellness recommendations.

## Results

The platform enabled Resonance Wellness Institute to grow from 50 to 500+ active clients while maintaining high satisfaction scores. Client retention increased by 85%, and coaches reported 40% time savings through automated administrative tasks.
