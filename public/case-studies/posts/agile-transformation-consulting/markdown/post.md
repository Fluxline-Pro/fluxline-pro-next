# Intermountain Health: Agile Transformation & Infrastructure

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISCLAIMER**: This project is the proprietary intellectual property of Intermountain Health. This case study demonstrates Fluxline's capability to transform siloed development teams into high-performing Agile units through process restructuring, infrastructure implementation, and Scrum leadership. All work was performed as Principal Engineer and Scrum Lead under employment with Intermountain Health. No proprietary code, screenshots, or confidential information is disclosed.

## Executive Summary

Intermountain Health required rapid transformation of a siloed development team to deliver MyIntermountain—a comprehensive enterprise intranet serving 65,000+ employees, contractors, and affiliated providers—within an aggressive **9-month timeline**. The challenge was to restructure team operations, implement Agile methodology from scratch, and build the complete development infrastructure while maintaining delivery velocity.

Fluxline's approach combined Scrum leadership, infrastructure architecture (Jira, Confluence, CI/CD pipelines), and cross-functional team coordination to transform chaos into predictable delivery cadences.

**Key Results:**

- ✅ 2-week sprint cadence with structured dev/QA cycles
- ✅ 300%+ team efficiency improvement from baseline
- ✅ Complete DevOps infrastructure from ground zero
- ✅ On-schedule delivery of enterprise intranet to 65K+ users
- ✅ Template processes adopted across future enterprise initiatives

---

## The Challenge

### Business Context

Intermountain Health needed to deliver MyIntermountain within 9 months, but the development team faced:

1. **Complete isolation**: Team members worked in siloes with no understanding of cross-functional responsibilities
2. **Zero Agile practices**: No sprint cadences, Scrum ceremonies, or standardized development lifecycle
3. **No infrastructure**: Missing DevOps tooling, version control standards, and CI/CD pipelines
4. **Aggressive timeline**: 9-month delivery window requiring immediate transformation
5. **External coordination**: Interface required with RightPoint contracted development partner

### Technical Challenges

- **Process vacuum**: No established Scrum framework, sprint planning, or retrospectives
- **Infrastructure gap**: Missing Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Git repository architecture
- **Change Management**: No governance framework for enterprise healthcare compliance
- **CI/CD absence**: Manual deployment processes creating bottlenecks
- **Cross-team coordination**: Alignment needed between internal teams and external contractors

### What Was at Stake

Without rapid Agile transformation, Intermountain Health faced:

- Missed delivery deadlines for critical enterprise intranet
- Continued team dysfunction and unpredictable velocity
- Quality issues from lack of structured QA cycles
- Inability to scale processes for future enterprise initiatives

---

## The Solution
