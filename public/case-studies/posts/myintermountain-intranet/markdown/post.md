## Executive Summary

Intermountain Health required a scalable, secure enterprise intranet platform that unified Microsoft 365, Azure identity services, and SharePoint Online to create a future-ready employee experience hub. The challenge was to architect and deliver this complex infrastructure within **9 months** while ensuring seamless integration across multiple enterprise systems.

Fluxline's approach combined Azure backend architecture, SharePoint Online frontend development, automated provisioning workflows, and enterprise SSO integration, all delivered through agile methodology as Scrum lead.

**Key Results:**

- ✅ 9-month delivery of complete enterprise infrastructure
- ✅ Automated provisioning with Power Automate and custom Spark tool
- ✅ Seamless Azure Entra ID and PING SSO integration
- ✅ Unified Microsoft 365 employee experience
- ✅ Scalable architecture supporting organizational growth

---

## The Challenge

### Business Context

Intermountain Health needed a modern intranet platform that could:

1. **Unify employee experience** across Microsoft 365 services (SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Search)
2. **Automate provisioning** for thousands of sites, reducing manual overhead
3. **Integrate enterprise SSO** with existing PING infrastructure and Azure Entra ID
4. **Scale efficiently** to support a large healthcare organization
5. **Deliver within 9 months** with cross-functional team coordination

### Technical Challenges

- **Complex authentication layer**: Bridging Azure Entra ID with legacy PING SSO
- **Automated provisioning requirements**: Diverse site creation needs with approval workflows
- **Microsoft 365 integration**: Unified experience across SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Search
- **Compressed timeline**: 9-month delivery window requiring aggressive sprint planning
- **Cross-functional coordination**: Development, QA, stakeholders, and executive leadership

### What Was at Stake
