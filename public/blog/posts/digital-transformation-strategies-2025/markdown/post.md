## What Digital Transformation Really Means

- **Data Strategy** → Use data not just to report, but to guide decisions.
- **Customer Experience** → Meet users where they are—digitally, intuitively, and with empathy.
- **Organizational Culture** → Build a mindset of agility, experimentation, and continuous learning.
