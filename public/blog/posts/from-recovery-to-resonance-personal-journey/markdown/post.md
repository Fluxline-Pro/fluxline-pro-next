# From Recovery to Resonance: My Personal Training Transformation

In 2017, I stood at 120 lbs., newly emerging from recovery and living with HIV. My doctor's words echoed in my mind: _"You need to gain weight and build strength."_ But how? I had no roadmap, no training background, and no clear plan.

This wasn't just about getting stronger. This was about reclaiming sovereignty over my body and my life.

## The Initiation Gate 🔥

**The challenge was profound:**

Standing at 120 lbs., I looked in the mirror and saw fragility. My body was recovering, but my spirit needed rebuilding too. The questions haunted me:

- How do I move from weakness to strength?
- How do I train a body that's been through so much?
- How do I build muscle while managing a chronic condition?
- Where do I even start?

This wasn't just about fitness—it was about crossing a threshold into embodied sovereignty. It was about proving to myself that I could rebuild, that I could become strong again.

## The Descent Chamber 🌑

### The Early Days (2017-2022)

I started with what I had: determination and a willingness to learn.

**Foundation Building:**

- Hired personal trainers who taught me splits, core work, and proper form
- Focused on nutrition—eating to build, not just to survive
- Learned about progressive overload and functional movement patterns
- Invested in a Tonal system in 2022 to train consistently at home

The physical work was hard. But something else was happening alongside the strength training—I was discovering emotional clarity through the practice itself.

**The Breakthrough:**

Training wasn't just physical. Each session became a meditation. Each rep became a ritual. I started integrating breathwork, body awareness, and emotional check-ins into my routine.

This is when the **Resonance Core Framework™** began to take shape in my mind.

### Formalization (2022-2025)

As I grew stronger physically, I realized I was developing a methodology:

**What I Was Learning:**

- **Emotional Intelligence in Training**: How to recognize emotional blocks that manifest as physical tension
- **Somatic Practices**: Breathwork and body awareness enhanced performance
- **Archetypal Mapping**: Understanding my unique patterns and thresholds
- **Ritual and Transformation**: Training as sacred practice, not just exercise

**The Decision:**

In 2024, I decided to formalize this knowledge. I enrolled in the **NASM Certification Program** and completed it in December 2025. But I didn't just learn the standard curriculum—I integrated the **OTP (Optimum Performance Training™) Model** into my Resonance Core Framework™.

This wasn't just about getting certified. It was about grounding my intuitive wisdom in professional standards.

## The Integration Seal ☀️

### Physical Transformation

Eight years later, the numbers tell part of the story:

- **Weight**: 120 lbs. → 185 lbs. (65 lbs. of healthy muscle)
- **Body Fat**: 10% (peak physical composition)
- **Strength**: Training at peak capacity with functional movement mastery
- **Health**: Thriving, managing my condition with confidence

But the numbers don't tell the whole story.

### The Real Transformation

**What Changed:**

- **Confidence**: I walk differently. I carry myself with sovereignty.
- **Discipline**: I understand consistency, patience, and the long game.
- **Emotional Mastery**: I can recognize and work through emotional blocks.
- **Purpose**: I now help others cross their own thresholds.

**The Methodology:**

The **Resonance Core Framework™** became my teaching tool:

- **Physical Training**: NASM-certified programming with OTP principles
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Archetypal mapping and breakthrough documentation
- **Somatic Practices**: Breathwork, movement patterns, body awareness
- **Symbolic Rituals**: Transformational practices aligned with personal evolution

### Guiding Others

Now, I work with clients using this integrated approach:

**What I Offer:**

- Personalized strength training programs (NASM-certified)
- Emotional intelligence integration in every session
- Somatic practices and breathwork coaching
- Archetypal mapping for understanding personal patterns
- Support for those navigating chronic conditions
- Training as transformation, not just exercise

**Client Transformations:**

My clients aren't just getting stronger—they're crossing thresholds. They're reclaiming sovereignty. They're discovering that physical training can be emotional healing.

## The Living Curriculum 🕊️

This journey has become a **living curriculum gate**—a teaching methodology based on lived experience.

### What I Learned (That I Now Teach)

1. **Embodied Authority**: Transformation comes from doing, not just knowing
2. **Technical Grounding**: Certification grounds intuitive wisdom in professional standards
3. **Integration Over Separation**: Physical and emotional work are one practice
4. **Adaptive Methodology**: Meet yourself (and your clients) where you are
5. **Threshold Crossing**: Training is ritual. Transformation is sacred.

### The Resonance Core Difference

Traditional personal training focuses on reps, sets, and physical metrics. The **Resonance Core Framework™** integrates:

- **NASM OTP Model**: Evidence-based programming and periodization
- **Archetypal Mapping**: Understanding unique patterns and emotional blocks
- **Emotional Emergence**: Sessions become breakthrough documentation
- **Somatic Alignment**: Body awareness enhances performance
- **Symbolic Ritual**: Training as sacred practice

## What I'd Tell My 2017 Self

Looking back at that 120 lb. version of me, here's what I wish I'd known:

1. **It takes time**: 8 years. Be patient with yourself.
2. **You're not broken**: You're rebuilding. There's a difference.
3. **Training is medicine**: Physical work heals more than just the body.
4. **Find your why**: The deeper the reason, the stronger the commitment.
5. **Document everything**: Your journey will teach others.
6. **You'll get certified**: And it will ground everything you've learned.
7. **You'll help others**: Your story becomes their map.
