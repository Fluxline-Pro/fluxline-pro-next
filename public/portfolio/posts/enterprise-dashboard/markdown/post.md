## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive **Decision Integrity Index (DII) Dashboard** for Fluxline Resonance Group to transform strategic decision-making through emotional resonance analytics. The platform integrates **Notion API**, **Microsoft 365**, and **Power Automate** to create a unified decision management system that maps all company decisions to emotional archetypes, strategic indexes, and threshold frameworks—ensuring every business move aligns with core values and long-term vision.

## Business Context

Fluxline needed a systematic approach to track strategic decisions across multiple dimensions:

- **Emotional Resonance**: Measuring alignment with company values and emotional intelligence
- **Archetype Mapping**: Connecting decisions to psychological frameworks (The Guardian, The Warrior, The Mythmaker, etc.)
- **Threshold Categorization**: Organizing decisions across Meta-System, Creative, Professional, Financial, Statistical/KPI, Somatic, and Emotional/Relational domains
- **Automated Workflows**: Seamless integration between Notion decision logging and Microsoft 365 productivity tools
- **Business Intelligence**: Real-time dashboards tracking Decision Integrity Index (DII) scores and strategic alignment

## Technical Implementation

### Notion Database Architecture

Designed comprehensive decision tracking database with:

- **Decision Logging Table**: Captures all strategic decisions with metadata (type, status, scope, thresholds)
- **Emotional Resonance Scoring**: Light and shadow emotional indexes measuring decision quality
- **Archetype Tagging**: Primary and secondary archetype assignments for psychological alignment
- **Business Goals Mapping**: Direct linkage to content resonance, client resonance, system integration, and other strategic objectives
- **Activation Domains**: Tracking decision implementation across operational areas
- **DRIVE Alignment**: Integration with Fluxline's DRIVE framework for strategic justification

### Microsoft 365 Integration

Built automated workflows connecting Notion to M365 ecosystem:

- **Power Automate Flows**: Trigger notifications when client engagements occur
- **Email Integration**: Automated alerts routed directly to Notion database
- **Microsoft Planner Export**: Quarterly and monthly status reports auto-populated
- **Microsoft To-Do Sync**: Employee task management synchronized with Notion decisions
- **AI Meeting Summarization**: Automated documentation of meeting notes into Notion

## Key Features

### 1. Decision Integrity Index (DII) Dashboard

Built comprehensive analytics dashboard visualizing:

- **4.72 Average DII Score**: Real-time composite score across all strategic decisions (4.5+ target)
- **Emotional Archetype Distribution**: Circular visualization showing decision alignment across 24 archetypes
- **Threshold Breakdown**: Percentage distribution across Meta-System, Creative, Professional, Financial, Statistical/KPI, Somatic, and Emotional/Relational categories
- **Historical Tracking**: Trend analysis showing decision quality over time
- **Shadow Signal Index (SSI)**: Measuring emotional blind spots and potential misalignments

### 2. Decision Logging & Tracking System

Created comprehensive Notion database structure:

- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Light and shadow emotional resonance indexes
- **Archetype Mapping**: Primary and secondary psychological archetype assignments
- **Business Goals Alignment**: Direct mapping to strategic objectives and KPIs
- **Threshold Categorization**: Organized across 7 core decision domains
- **Status Workflows**: Proposed → In Progress → Done → Cancelled lifecycle tracking
- **Activation Domain Tagging**: Linking decisions to operational implementation areas

### 3. Microsoft 365 Workflow Automation

Integrated seamless automation across M365 ecosystem:

- **Power Automate Flows**: Client engagement triggers automatic Notion updates
- **Email Notifications**: Bidirectional sync between Outlook and Notion
- **Microsoft Planner Export**: Quarterly/monthly reports auto-populated from decision data
- **To-Do Integration**: Employee task lists synchronized with strategic decisions
- **Meeting Intelligence**: AI-powered summarization directly documented into Notion

### 4. Decision Template & Process Documentation

Established repeatable frameworks:

- **DRIVE Justification Template**: Standardized decision documentation format
- **Threshold Framework**: Guidelines for categorizing decisions by domain
- **Emotional Scoring Rubric**: Consistent criteria for resonance assessment
- **Archetype Glossary**: Comprehensive reference for psychological mapping
- **Process Playbooks**: Step-by-step guides for decision logging and review

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Notion API Rate Limits

**Problem**: Frequent API calls for dashboard updates and Power Automate workflows approaching rate limits.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent caching layer, batched database queries, and optimized webhook triggers to minimize API requests while maintaining real-time accuracy.

### Challenge 2: Emotional Scoring Consistency

**Problem**: Subjective nature of emotional resonance scoring required standardization for reliable analytics.

**Solution**: Developed comprehensive scoring rubric with clear criteria, created archetype glossary with examples, and implemented Shadow Signal Index (SSI) to detect scoring inconsistencies.

### Challenge 3: Cross-Platform Integration Complexity

**Problem**: Synchronizing data between Notion, Power Automate, Planner, To-Do, and email systems created workflow fragmentation.

**Solution**: Built centralized Power Automate hub with standardized data transformation logic, implemented bidirectional sync protocols, and created monitoring dashboard for integration health.

## Results

- 🎯 **4.72 Average DII Score**: Exceeded 4.5+ target for decision quality across all strategic decisions
- 📈 **75% Client Engagement Increase**: Customer client index up 75% over six months since implementation
