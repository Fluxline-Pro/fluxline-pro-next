## Project Overview

Led the complete technical rebuild of **MyHealth 2.0**, Intermountain Health's enterprise patient portal, transforming it from Angular 8 to React.js (web) and React Native (mobile) within a compressed **4-month timeline** due to critical performance issues in the legacy system.

**Project Scope:**

- **Complete rewrite**: Angular 8 → React.js + React Native
- **Cross-platform delivery**: Unified codebase for web and mobile
- **Enterprise integrations**: HL7 interfaces, laboratory systems, financial services
- **Timeline**: 24 months for rebuild, 1 year total project delivery
- **Team structure**: Full development team, stakeholders, project managers, and executive leadership

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

**React.js Web Application:**

- Rebuilt entire web portal using React.js with Material UI design system
- Direct code ports from React Native to ensure feature parity
- Component-based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Performance optimization addressing legacy Angular 8 bottlenecks

**React Native Mobile Application:**

- Native mobile experience for iOS and Android
- Shared component library with web application
- Material UI theming and design language
- Cross-platform code reuse and optimization

### Enterprise System Integrations

Interfaced with multiple healthcare IT systems:

- **HL7 Standards**: Healthcare data interchange protocols
- **iCentra**: Clinical information system
- **RadNet**: Radiology information system
- **SunQuest Laboratories**: Laboratory information management
- **RevCycle**: Revenue cycle management
- **Internal Financial Systems**: Billing and payment processing
- **WebCollect**: Payment collection services

### Agile Methodology & Delivery

**Sprint Cadences:**

- 2-week sprint cycles with consistent velocity tracking
- Daily standups and sprint planning ceremonies
- Retrospectives and continuous improvement

**Scrum Master Leadership:**

- Facilitated all Scrum ceremonies (planning, review, retrospective)
- Removed blockers and coordinated cross-functional dependencies
- Maintained team focus and delivery momentum

**Stakeholder Collaboration:**

- Regular demos and feedback sessions
- Coordination with project managers and executive leadership
- Technical consultations with engineering teams and healthcare consultants

## Design Approach

**Material UI Design System:**

- Google's Material Design language for consistency
- Healthcare-appropriate color theming and accessibility
- Responsive layouts across all device sizes
- Touch-friendly mobile interactions

**User Experience:**

- Patient-first interface design
- Simplified workflows for lab results, appointments, billing
- Accessibility compliance for healthcare regulations
- Intuitive navigation for diverse patient demographics

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Compressed Timeline (24 months)

**Solution**: Prioritized direct code ports between React Native and React.js, leveraging shared component architecture and aggressive sprint planning to meet critical deadlines.

### Challenge: Legacy Performance Issues

**Solution**: Identified Angular 8 performance bottlenecks and architected React solution with optimized rendering, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

### Challenge: Complex Healthcare Integrations

**Solution**: Coordinated with multiple vendor systems (HL7, iCentra, RadNet, SunQuest) to ensure seamless data flow and real-time patient information updates.

### Challenge: Cross-Platform Consistency

**Solution**: Established shared component library and design patterns between React.js and React Native, ensuring unified patient experience across web and mobile.

## Key Learnings

1. **Enterprise Healthcare IT**: Deep understanding of HL7 standards, healthcare data workflows, and regulatory requirements
2. **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Effective code sharing strategies between React.js and React Native
3. **Agile at Scale**: Leading Scrum ceremonies and stakeholder management in large enterprise environment
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and resolving critical performance issues under tight deadlines
5. **Team Collaboration**: Coordinating with engineers, consultants, project managers, and executive leadership

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- React Native
- Material UI (Google)
- HL7 Integration Standards
- Agile/Scrum Methodology
- Healthcare IT Systems (iCentra, RadNet, SunQuest, RevCycle, WebCollect)
- Enterprise Architecture Patterns

## Results

- **4-month rebuild** addressing critical Angular 8 performance issues
- **Unified cross-platform experience** for web and mobile patients
- **Successful enterprise integrations** with 6+ healthcare IT systems
- **On-time delivery** within 1-year total project timeline
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** from project managers and executive leadership
