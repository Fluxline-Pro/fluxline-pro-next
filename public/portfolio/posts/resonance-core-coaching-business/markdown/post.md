# Resonance Core Coaching Business

A differentiated wellness coaching business built on the **Resonance Core Framework™**—a proprietary methodology integrating **NASM-certified personal training** with emotional intelligence, somatic practices, and archetypal mapping.

## Project Overview

This portfolio piece documents the development of a scalable coaching business that achieves 85% client retention, commands premium pricing (2-3x industry rates), and generates sustainable recurring revenue through a unique, defensible methodology.

**Business Highlights:**

- **85% client retention** (vs. 20-40% industry average)
- **Premium pricing**: $225-$450/month (vs. $30-50/session industry standard)
- **60% referral rate** (organic growth through transformations)
- **Proprietary framework**: Resonance Core Framework™ creates competitive moat
- **Scalable model**: 1:1 services transitioning to group, digital, and certification offerings

## The Business Challenge

### The Problem: Commoditized Personal Training Market

**Industry Pain Points:**

- Oversaturated market with low differentiation
- Race to the bottom on pricing ($30-50/session)
- High client churn (60-80% within 6 months)
- Transactional relationships instead of transformational
- Limited scalability (trading time for money)

**Market Gap:**

Traditional personal training focuses on physical metrics only, while life coaching addresses emotional work without tangible physical results. There was no integrated offering combining both.

**The Opportunity:**

Create a differentiated coaching business that:

1. Integrates physical training with emotional intelligence
2. Commands premium pricing through unique methodology
3. Achieves high retention through transformational results
4. Builds scalable assets (framework, content, certification)

## The Solution: Resonance Core Framework™

### Business Model Innovation

**Core Value Proposition:**

"Physical training with emotional intelligence—where every session is a scroll, every insight a gate, and transformation is felt, not just measured."

**Differentiation Strategy:**

1. **NASM Certification**: Professional credibility and evidence-based programming
2. **Resonance Core Framework™**: Proprietary methodology integrating physical, emotional, and somatic work
3. **Personal Transformation**: Authentic story (120 lbs. → 185 lbs.) as marketing asset
4. **Holistic Approach**: Addresses root causes, not just symptoms
5. **Community & Support**: Long-term relationships, not transactional sessions

### Service Architecture

**Multi-Tier Offerings:**

| Tier                   | Target Audience     | Price Point  | Key Features                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Session**     | Trial clients       | $110/session | Simplified instruction, no commitment          |
| **Online PT**          | Remote/creatives    | $225+/month  | Flexible support, digital programming          |
| **Hybrid PT**          | Local clients       | $350+/month  | In-person + remote structure                   |
| **Online Hypertrophy** | Physique-focused    | $275+/month  | Nutrition + metabolic coaching                 |
| **Hybrid Hypertrophy** | Full transformation | $450+/month  | Physical + emotional + nutritional integration |
