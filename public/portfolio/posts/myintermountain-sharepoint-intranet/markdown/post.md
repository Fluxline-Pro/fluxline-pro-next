## Project Overview

Architected and delivered **MyIntermountain**, a scalable enterprise intranet platform for Intermountain Health built on SharePoint Online with comprehensive Azure backend services, automated provisioning workflows, and enterprise SSO integration. Delivered complete infrastructure within **9 months** as Scrum lead coordinating cross-functional teams.

**Project Scope:**

- **Azure backend architecture**: Authentication, provisioning, and automation services
- **SharePoint Online frontend**: Microsoft 365-integrated employee experience
- **Automated provisioning**: Power Automate and Spark-based workflows
- **Enterprise SSO**: Azure Entra ID and PING integration
- **Timeline**: 9 months from architecture to production delivery
- **Leadership**: Scrum lead managing agile delivery, QA, and CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Implementation

### Azure Backend Architecture

The backend infrastructure leverages Azure's cloud services to provide scalable, secure automation and authentication capabilities. This architecture ensures seamless integration across Microsoft 365 services while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

**Infrastructure Services:**

- Azure Functions for serverless backend logic
- Power Automate for workflow automation and provisioning
- Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for identity management
- Microsoft Graph API for M365 service integration
- Automated content and permissions management

**Authentication & Identity:**

A hybrid authentication system integrates Azure Entra ID with existing enterprise SSO infrastructure to provide secure, seamless access across all platforms.

- Azure Entra ID single sign-on (SSO) integration
- PING SSO for enterprise authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and permissions management
- Seamless OneDrive and SharePoint Online authentication

### SharePoint Online & Microsoft 365 Integration

The employee-facing intranet provides a unified experience by integrating SharePoint Online with the full Microsoft 365 ecosystem. This approach reduces tool fragmentation and improves productivity through seamless service integration.

**Frontend Experience:**

- SharePoint Online as primary employee portal
- Microsoft 365 service integration (Teams, OneDrive, Planner)
- SPFx (SharePoint Framework) web parts for custom functionality
- Microsoft Search integration for unified content discovery
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

**Content Management:**

Automated content workflows and Microsoft Graph API integration enable efficient document management and permissions control across the enterprise.

- OneDrive integration for personal file storage
- SharePoint Online document libraries and lists
- Permissions management via Graph API
- Content migration and organization workflows

### Provisioning & Automation

**Spark Provisioning Tool** (RightPoint proprietary runtime engine used for this project):

This custom-built C# provisioning engine automates the creation and configuration of SharePoint sites, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent deployments across the enterprise.

- Custom provisioning application built with C#
- Automated site creation and configuration
- Template-based provisioning workflows
- Integration with Power Automate for approval processes

**Power Automate Workflows:**

Power Automate orchestrates complex approval processes and governance workflows, connecting business users with backend automation services without requiring technical expertise.

- Automated provisioning request handling
- Content approval and governance workflows
- User onboarding and offboarding automation
- Integration with Azure backend services

## Agile Leadership & Delivery

- Facilitated daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives
- Managed cross-functional team coordination (development, QA, stakeholders)
- Maintained product backlog and sprint velocity tracking
- Led CI/CD pipeline setup and deployment strategy

**Quality Assurance:**

Comprehensive testing standards and automated QA processes ensured enterprise-grade reliability and security compliance throughout development and deployment.

- Established testing standards and QA processes
- Coordinated UAT (User Acceptance Testing) with stakeholders
- Implemented automated testing for provisioning workflows
- Ensured security and compliance standards

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

Automated build and deployment pipelines enabled rapid iteration and consistent releases across multiple environments.

- Azure DevOps pipeline configuration
- Automated build and deployment processes
- Environment management (dev, test, staging, production)
- Version control and release management

## Design Approach

**Employee Experience:**

The design prioritizes user productivity and accessibility, creating a seamless digital workplace that reduces friction and improves information discovery.

- Intuitive intranet navigation and information architecture
- Unified Microsoft 365 integration reducing tool fragmentation
- Mobile-responsive design for remote workforce
- Search-first approach with Microsoft Search integration

**Security & Governance:**

Robust security controls and governance frameworks ensure compliance with healthcare industry standards while maintaining enterprise-grade data protection.

- Enterprise-grade authentication with Azure Entra ID
- Granular permissions management
- Compliance with healthcare industry standards
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Challenges & Solutions
