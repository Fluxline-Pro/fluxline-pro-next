## Personal Training Transformation Journey

An 8-year transformation journey from 120 lbs. and fragility to 185 lbs. and sovereignty, integrating **NASM-certified strength training** with the **Resonance Core Framework™**—a methodology that blends physical training with emotional intelligence, somatic practices, and archetypal mapping.

## Project Overview

This portfolio piece documents my personal transformation journey and the development of a proprietary coaching methodology that integrates technical training credentials with emotional intelligence and somatic practices.

**What makes this project unique:**

- Personal transformation as living curriculum (120 lbs. → 185 lbs., 10% body fat)
- NASM Certified Personal Trainer with OTP specialization
- Proprietary **Resonance Core Framework™** development
- Integration of physical training with emotional and somatic work
- Application to client coaching and business development

## The Challenge

**Starting Point (2017):**

- 120 lbs., emerging from recovery
- Living with HIV, managing chronic health condition
- No training background or roadmap
- Physical fragility coupled with need for emotional sovereignty
- Doctor's recommendation: "You need to gain weight and build strength"

**The Core Question:**

How do you transform not just a body, but integrate physical training with emotional healing, somatic awareness, and personal evolution?

## The Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (2017-2022)

**Strength Training Fundamentals:**

- Progressive overload programming
- Functional movement patterns
- Compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, presses)
- Split training (push/pull/legs)
- Core stability and mobility work

**Nutritional Optimization:**

- Caloric surplus for muscle building
- Macronutrient optimization (protein, carbs, fats)
- Meal timing and frequency
- Supplementation for recovery and health

**Mentorship & Learning:**

- Worked with certified personal trainers
- Learned proper form and technique
- Studied training methodologies
- Invested in Tonal home training system (2022)

### Phase 2: Integration & Methodology Development (2022-2025)

**Emotional Intelligence Integration:**

As physical training progressed, I recognized patterns:

- Emotional blocks manifesting as physical tension
- Breathwork enhancing performance and recovery
- Training sessions becoming meditative practices
- Movement as ritual and transformation

**Somatic Practices:**

- Breathwork techniques for nervous system regulation
- Body awareness and proprioception
- Somatic movement patterns
- Mind-body connection in training

**Archetypal Mapping:**

- Understanding personal patterns and thresholds
- Identifying emotional blocks preventing progress
- Mapping transformation as hero's journey
- Creating symbolic rituals around training

**NASM Certification (December 2025):**

- Enrolled in NASM Personal Trainer Certification
- Studied Optimum Performance Training™ (OTP) Model
- Integrated OTP Model into Resonance Core Framework™
- Achieved professional certification grounding intuitive wisdom

### Phase 3: Framework Development

**The Resonance Core Framework™:**

A proprietary methodology integrating:

1. **Physical Training (NASM OTP Model)**
   - Assessment protocols
   - Program design and periodization
   - Evidence-based exercise selection
   - Progressive overload strategies

2. **Emotional Intelligence**
   - Archetypal mapping
   - Breakthrough documentation
   - Emotional emergence work
   - Pattern recognition and integration

3. **Somatic Practices**
   - Breathwork protocols
   - Movement patterns and body awareness
   - Nervous system regulation
   - Mind-body connection techniques

4. **Symbolic Rituals**
   - Transformational practices
   - Training as sacred practice
   - Threshold crossing ceremonies
   - Personal evolution rituals

## The Results

### Physical Transformation

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- **Weight**: 120 lbs. → 185 lbs. (65 lbs. healthy muscle gain)
