4. Hover over video to see controls (desktop)
5. Click mute button to hear audio
6. After video ends, click replay to watch again

## Video Optimization Tips

For best web performance:
1. **Compression**: Use H.264 codec with reasonable bitrate
   - Recommended: 5-8 Mbps for 1080p
   - Higher for 4K but test load times
2. **File size**: Keep under 50MB if possible
3. **Length**: 30-60 seconds is ideal for web
4. **Audio**: Include clear audio but video works muted too
5. **Format**: MP4 is universally supported

## Tools for Video Conversion

If you need to convert your video:
- **HandBrake** (free, all platforms)
- **FFmpeg** (command line)
- **Adobe Media Encoder** (if you have Creative Cloud)
- **Online converters**: CloudConvert, Online-Convert

## Caption Generation Tools

For creating WebVTT captions:
- **YouTube Studio** (auto-generate, then download as SRT and convert)
- **Rev.com** (paid transcription service)
- **Manual**: Use the sample file as template
- **Subtitle Edit** (free desktop software)
